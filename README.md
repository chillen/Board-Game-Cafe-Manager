# Board Game Cafe DB (SCHOOL)

This is my databases final project. This is an application that manages
board game recommendations, food preferences, and basic menu management.

The application was developed to test my knowledge of SQL and Swing GUI 
development.

You will require [SQLite JDBC](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc) for SQL
database management.

## Usage

This hasn't been maintained in years, so I'm not sure how well it runs!
Don't worry about maintaining, I sure won't. :)
